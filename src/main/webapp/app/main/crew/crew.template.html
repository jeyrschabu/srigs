                    <h4>Co-Founder</h4>
                    <p>Adam is an avid tech enthusiast who, by all metrics, has played too many games. Enthusiastically addicted to movies, TV, books, design and music with an unbridled and tenacious passion for all things meat related. Second place Fabio look alike. When he's not preoccupied hand-crafting works of art both in design and development, he has a fondness for indulging in competitive games and writing unnecessarily verbosely. While undeservedly a self proclaimed expert in many things, he has always had a fervor for PC hardware, the more ridiculously powerful and overkill, the better.</p>
