It's based on the new Fiji GPU, and boasts a massive 4096 stream processors for an amazing graphics power to tackle whatever you throw at it. It also incorporates AMD-pioneered High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM), a groundbreaking stacked memory solution that offers incredible 4096-bit memory bus, plus lower voltage and smaller footprint compared to the traditional GDDR5 memory. The result is the highest AMD GPU memory bandwidth ever, lower power consumption and a reduced card length. A rich array of AMD GPU technologies offer more than one way to elevate your gaming experience, like AMD Freesync Technology for smooth, tear-free gaming, Frame Rate Target Control (FRTC) for less power consumption by limiting the target frame rate, and Virtual Super Resolution (VSR) that delivers brilliant 4K experience, even on a 1080p display.\n\nIn addition to impressive performance, the R9 Fury X comes with industrial styling that looks as great as the card performs. A closed loop liquid cooling solution keeps the GPU cool and at whisper-quiet noise level for immersive gaming. An illuminating \"RADEON\" logo lets you show off your high end component, and the GPU Tach activity indicator gives you quick view of the GPU load level. Moreover, with a slim, compact form factor roughly 7.5\" in length, this card can easily fit into cases of various sizes and shapes, thus your next gaming powerhouse could be cute and space-efficient like never before.\n\nnewegg\nHIGH-BANDWIDTH MEMORY (HBM)\nGround-breaking performance requires big bandwidth.

The 600Q is built to keep your PC whisper-quiet, no matter what's running inside. Sound damping material is built into the solid steel front, top and side panels, and the three-speed fan controller lets you pick your optimal noise and cooling performance levels.</p> <p>600Q's gorgeous external looks conceal an equally beautiful internal layout. Secure your cables with cleverly-positioned tie downs and routing grommets. Cleanly house the PSU and drive bays behind removable covers, optimally positioned to increase direct airflow — and decrease fan usage.</p> <p>600Q's inverse ATX case design brings cool air directly to the components by eliminating obstruction from extra, unused drive bays. Natural airflow keeps fan noise to a minimum. Need big-time cooling for the latest and most powerful PC components? 600Q includes a variety of factory fan mounting positions, making it simple to step up to liquid CPU and GPU coolers. Keep your system quiet and cool with high-density sound damping material on both side panels, the front panel, and top panel.

        "longDescription": "The ASUS PCE-AC56 is a 802.11ac Wi-Fi PCI Express adapter which upgrades your desktop from tangle-some Ethernet cables to carefree industry-leading 802.11ac at up to 867 Mbps. Broadcom TurboQAM technology super-charges 2.4 GHz 802.11n performance from 300 Mbps to 400 Mbps with compatible devices. Plus, the stylish external magnetized antenna base gives you more flexibility in adjusting antenna placement to get the best signal reception quality possible.                                                                                                                                                                   The PCE-AC56 uses Broadcom's new 5th generation Wi-Fi 802.11ac chipset to reach speeds of up to 867 Mbps through the 5 GHz band, which is three times faster than 802.11n Wi-Fi. At the same time, it maintains full backward compatibility with all previous Wi-Fi protocols, providing high performance two-way transmission while ensuring a smooth transition to 802.11ac and seamless interconnection with existing devices.",

It also incorporates AMD-pioneered High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM), a groundbreaking stacked memory solution that offers incredible 4096-bit memory bus, plus lower voltage and smaller footprint compared to the traditional GDDR5 memory. The result is the highest AMD GPU memory bandwidth ever, lower power consumption and a reduced card length. A rich array of AMD GPU technologies offer more than one way to elevate your gaming experience, like AMD Freesync Technology for smooth, tear-free gaming, Frame Rate Target Control (FRTC) for less power consumption by limiting the target frame rate, and Virtual Super Resolution (VSR) that delivers brilliant 4K experience, even on a 1080p display.\n\nIn addition to impressive performance, the R9 Fury X comes with industrial styling that looks as great as the card performs. A closed loop liquid cooling solution keeps the GPU cool and at whisper-quiet noise level for immersive gaming. An illuminating \"RADEON\" logo lets you show off your high end component, and the GPU Tach activity indicator gives you quick view of the GPU load level.
