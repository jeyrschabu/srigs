Take the following into consideration when choosing a hard drive for your NAS:\nCompatibility: Without being tested for compatibility with your NAS system, optimum performance is not guaranteed.\nReliability: The always-on environment of a NAS or RAID is a hot one. And desktop drives aren't typically designed and tested in those conditions. WD Red is.\nError recovery Controls: WD Red NAS hard drives are specifically designed with RAID error recovery control to help reduce failures within the NAS system. Desktop drives are typically not designed for RAID environments where this can be an issue.\nNoise and Vibration Protection: Designed to operate solo, desktop drives offer little or no protection from the noise and vibration faced in a multi-drive system. WD Red drives are designed for multi-bay NAS systems.\n\nWD Red for Home\nStream, backup, share and organize your digital content at home with a NAS and WD Red drives designed to effortlessly share content to the devices in your home. Red NASware increases your drives' compatibility with your devices, TV, stereo and more. Live in a connected world.\n\nWD Red for Small Business\nBusinesses thrive on productivity and efficiency - two of the guiding principles built into the design of WD Red. It's the hard drive of choice for 1 to 8 bay systems. NASware 3.0 allows for seamless integration with your existing network so WD Red can share and backup files at the speed of your business. And for larger businesses with up to 16 bays, count on WD Red Pro.\n\nWD Red Pro for Big Business\nIf you're looking for maximum performance in a heavy use NAS, WD Red Pro delivers the same exceptional performance for the business customer. For NAS environments with 8 to 16 bays, WD Red Pro is designed to handle an increase in workload and comes with a 5-year limited warranty.",

This unique feature is accessible via On Screen Display (OSD) or Display Pilot for added convenience.\n\n\nADJUSTMENT SCALE DESIGN FOR EFFORTLESS SET-UP EVERY TIME\nTo ensure that gamers can duplicate the exact same monitor set-up with the highest accuracy, efficiency and convenience, BenQ made a few additions to the XL2430T's Adjustment Scale Design. The adjustable height stand is now scaled with 14 height levels traceable by a moving marker. Traceable scales are also added to the screen, which tilts forward and backward to 0, 10 and 20, and swivels left and right to a wide range of angles. Every XL2430T can be your personal XL2430T.\n\n\nTHE GAME MODE LOADER LETS YOU IN ON THE SECRET\nThe secret is out.

With millions on the line, top eSports professionals can depend on G900 Chaos Spectrum. Featuring a 1-millisecond report rate and our highly optimized 2.4GHz wireless connection, Chaos Spectrum delivers incredible responsiveness for competition-level twitch targeting.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nOUR MOST ACCURATE OPTICAL SENSOR\nPixel-precise performance\nChaos Spectrum comes equipped with the PMW3366 optical sensor - widely regarded as the best gaming mouse sensor on the market. PMW3366 has zero smoothing, filtering or acceleration across the entire DPI range (200-12,000DPI), delivering exceptional tracking accuracy and consistent responsiveness at any speed. For even better accuracy and speed, use surface tuning in Logitech Gaming Software to tune the sensor to your playing surface.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nLIGHTWEIGHT CONSTRUCTION\nSuperior comfort and speed\nEvery component of Chaos Spectrum has been optimized to reduce weight while maintaining stability. Each element of the construction was analyzed and adjusted to remove milligrams wherever possible, from thin wall molding to a hollow \"spoked\" hyperscroll wheel design. The result is a wireless mouse that weighs in at only 107g, maximizing comfort over extended periods of use and delivering quicker response to motion.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nAMBIDEXTROUS DESIGN\nCustomizable to fit your hand and style\nFully-configurable button layout and ambidextrous design allow for left- or right-handed use that works with nearly any mouse grip style, including palm, claw and fingertip grips.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nPOWER EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY\nFor high-endurance gameplay\nChaos Spectrum features exclusive clock-tuning technology that significantly reduces power consumption, so you can play for a continuous 32 hours - an entire competition weekend - on a single charge.* Battery Assistant in Logitech Gaming Software keeps you informed about your charge level and gives you an estimate of your remaining battery life.\n\n*Battery life up to 32 hours with lighting off, or 24 hours with default lighting.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nEXCLUSIVE CLOCK-TUNING TECHNOLOGY\nFaster and more reliable\nChaos Spectrum clock-tuning technology maximizes speed and battery life while minimizing degradation commonly caused by temperature, humidity, aging and part-to-part variances.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nMECHANICAL PIVOT BUTTON DESIGN\nFast, accurate and reliable click performance\nA metal spring tensioning system and metal pivot hinges are built into left and right mouse buttons for a crisp, clean click feel with rapid click feedback.

With drives up to 8TB, WD Red offers a wide array of solutions for customers looking to build the biggest, best-performing NAS storage solution. Built for single-bay to 8-bay NAS systems, WD Red packs the power to store your precious data in one powerhouse unit. With WD Red, you're ready for what's next.\n\nExclusive NASware 3.0\nNot just any drive will do. In single-bay to 8-bay NAS systems, WD Red raises the bar. Get as much as 64TB capacity, and with WD's exclusive NASware 3.0, you can optimize every single one of them. Built into every WD Red hard drive, NASware 3.0's advanced technology improves your system's storage performance by increasing compatibility, integration, upgradeability, and reliability.\n\nBuilt for optimum NAS compatibility\nDesktop drives aren't purpose-built for NAS. But WD Red drives with NASware are. Our exclusive technology takes the guesswork out of selecting a drive. WD Red is for small NAS systems, and our unique algorithm balances performance and reliability in NAS and RAID environments. Simply put, WD Red is the most compatible drive available for NAS enclosures. But don't take our word for it. WD Red is a reflection of the most extensive NAS partner compatibility-testing list that is available on the market.*\n*Compatibility list as of March 2016\n\nDesktop drives vs. WD Red\nIn a Network Attached Storage device, a desktop hard drive is not designed for NAS environments. Do right by your NAS and choose the drive with an array of features to preserve your data and maintain optimum performance. Take the following into consideration when choosing a hard drive for your NAS:\nCompatibility: Without being tested for compatibility with your NAS system, optimum performance is not guaranteed.\nReliability: The always-on environment of a NAS or RAID is a hot one. And desktop drives aren't typically designed and tested in those conditions. WD Red is.\nError recovery Controls: WD Red NAS hard drives are specifically designed with RAID error recovery control to help reduce failures within the NAS system. Desktop drives are typically not designed for RAID environments where this can be an issue.\nNoise and Vibration Protection: Designed to operate solo, desktop drives offer little or no protection from the noise and vibration faced in a multi-drive system. WD Red drives are designed for multi-bay NAS systems.\n\nWD Red for Home\nStream, backup, share and organize your digital content at home with a NAS and WD Red drives designed to effortlessly share content to the devices in your home. Red NASware increases your drives' compatibility with your devices, TV, stereo and more. Live in a connected world.\n\nWD Red for Small Business\nBusinesses thrive on productivity and efficiency - two of the guiding principles built into the design of WD Red. It's the hard drive of choice for 1 to 8 bay systems. NASware 3.0 allows for seamless integration with your existing network so WD Red can share and backup files at the speed of your business. And for larger businesses with up to 16 bays, count on WD Red Pro.\n\nWD Red Pro for Big Business\nIf you're looking for maximum performance in a heavy use NAS, WD Red Pro delivers the same exceptional performance for the business customer. For NAS environments with 8 to 16 bays, WD Red Pro is designed to handle an increase in workload and comes with a 5-year limited warranty.",

Gaming is in the details that matter. This is why our engineers and designers strive to perfect every detail that may ultimately contribute to the triumph of the game.\n\n\n\nGAMING REFRESH RATE OPTIMIZATION MANAGEMENT (GROM)\nBenQ manages to provide more than just the refresh rate feature for different resolutions, but allows users to reach more levels of optimal refresh rates (100/120/144Hz) with Gaming Refresh rate Optimization Management (GROM).

The Belkin Conserve Surge Protector with Timer is a cost- and energy-saving solution for businesses that want to save money and reduce their carbon footprint. It helps eliminate wasted \"standby\" power right at the workstation - where nearly half of all IT energy costs originate. Its automatic timer makes saving money and energy simple while empowering employees to make an impact. With the touch of a button, employees can power their connected office electronics plugged into the six \"auto off\" outlets. The surge protector's automatic timer will eliminate power to those outlets after 11 hours. Prior to shutdown, users are warned with a blinking LED on the button in case they are still working. Two \"always on\" outlets keep PCs and other critical devices powered on at all times. Because it limits power consumption right at the workstation, the Conserve Surge Protector empowers organizations to control cost and employees to contribute to a greener office environment. Businesses will save money without compromising the productivity of employees.",

With drives up to 8TB, WD Red offers a wide array of solutions for customers looking to build the biggest, best-performing NAS storage solution. Built for single-bay to 8-bay NAS systems, WD Red packs the power to store your precious data in one powerhouse unit. With WD Red, you're ready for what's next.\n\nExclusive NASware 3.0\nNot just any drive will do. In single-bay to 8-bay NAS systems, WD Red raises the bar. Get as much as 64TB capacity, and with WD's exclusive NASware 3.0, you can optimize every single one of them. Built into every WD Red hard drive, NASware 3.0's advanced technology improves your system's storage performance by increasing compatibility, integration, upgradeability, and reliability.\n\nBuilt for optimum NAS compatibility\nDesktop drives aren't purpose-built for NAS. But WD Red drives with NASware are. Our exclusive technology takes the guesswork out of selecting a drive. WD Red is for small NAS systems, and our unique algorithm balances performance and reliability in NAS and RAID environments. Simply put, WD Red is the most compatible drive available for NAS enclosures. But don't take our word for it. WD Red is a reflection of the most extensive NAS partner compatibility-testing list that is available on the market.*\n*Compatibility list as of March 2016\n\nDesktop drives vs. WD Red\nIn a Network Attached Storage device, a desktop hard drive is not designed for NAS environments. Do right by your NAS and choose the drive with an array of features to preserve your data and maintain optimum performance. Take the following into consideration when choosing a hard drive for your NAS:\nCompatibility: Without being tested for compatibility with your NAS system, optimum performance is not guaranteed.\nReliability: The always-on environment of a NAS or RAID is a hot one. And desktop drives aren't typically designed and tested in those conditions. WD Red is.\nError recovery Controls: WD Red NAS hard drives are specifically designed with RAID error recovery control to help reduce failures within the NAS system.

Built with perfect motion, fast gaming, precise control, intuitive experience and RevolutionEyes Technology, the 24\" battle machine is at the peak of design perfection.\n\n\nGAMING IS IN THE DETAILS THAT MATTER\nFrom years of expertise in the development of professional gaming monitors and every close encounter with legendary gamers around the world, we have learned that what defines a truly victorious gaming monitor, or should you say \"the best gaming monitor\", really depends on the performance-driven features that make the critical difference between victory and defeat. Gaming is in the details that matter. This is why our engineers and designers strive to perfect every detail that may ultimately contribute to the triumph of the game.\n\n\n\nGAMING REFRESH RATE OPTIMIZATION MANAGEMENT (GROM)\nBenQ manages to provide more than just the refresh rate feature for different resolutions, but allows users to reach more levels of optimal refresh rates (100/120/144Hz) with Gaming Refresh rate Optimization Management (GROM). GROM aims to bring users incomparable gaming performance.

The adjustable height stand is now scaled with 14 height levels traceable by a moving marker.

The Belkin Conserve Surge Protector with Timer is a cost- and energy-saving solution for businesses that want to save money and reduce their carbon footprint. It helps eliminate wasted \"standby\" power right at the workstation - where nearly half of all IT energy costs originate. Its automatic timer makes saving money and energy simple while empowering employees to make an impact. With the touch of a button, employees can power their connected office electronics plugged into the six \"auto off\" outlets. The surge protector's automatic timer will eliminate power to those outlets after 11 hours. Prior to shutdown, users are warned with a blinking LED on the button in case they are still working. Two \"always on\" outlets keep PCs and other critical devices powered on at all times. Because it limits power consumption right at the workstation, the Conserve Surge Protector empowers organizations to control cost and employees to contribute to a greener office environment. Businesses will save money without compromising the productivity of employees.",

With millions on the line, top eSports professionals can depend on G900 Chaos Spectrum. Featuring a 1-millisecond report rate and our highly optimized 2.4GHz wireless connection, Chaos Spectrum delivers incredible responsiveness for competition-level twitch targeting.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nOUR MOST ACCURATE OPTICAL SENSOR\nPixel-precise performance\nChaos Spectrum comes equipped with the PMW3366 optical sensor - widely regarded as the best gaming mouse sensor on the market. PMW3366 has zero smoothing, filtering or acceleration across the entire DPI range (200-12,000DPI), delivering exceptional tracking accuracy and consistent responsiveness at any speed. For even better accuracy and speed, use surface tuning in Logitech Gaming Software to tune the sensor to your playing surface.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nLIGHTWEIGHT CONSTRUCTION\nSuperior comfort and speed\nEvery component of Chaos Spectrum has been optimized to reduce weight while maintaining stability. Each element of the construction was analyzed and adjusted to remove milligrams wherever possible, from thin wall molding to a hollow \"spoked\" hyperscroll wheel design. The result is a wireless mouse that weighs in at only 107g, maximizing comfort over extended periods of use and delivering quicker response to motion.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nAMBIDEXTROUS DESIGN\nCustomizable to fit your hand and style\nFully-configurable button layout and ambidextrous design allow for left- or right-handed use that works with nearly any mouse grip style, including palm, claw and fingertip grips.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nPOWER EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY\nFor high-endurance gameplay\nChaos Spectrum features exclusive clock-tuning technology that significantly reduces power consumption, so you can play for a continuous 32 hours - an entire competition weekend - on a single charge.* Battery Assistant in Logitech Gaming Software keeps you informed about your charge level and gives you an estimate of your remaining battery life.\n\n*Battery life up to 32 hours with lighting off, or 24 hours with default lighting.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nEXCLUSIVE CLOCK-TUNING TECHNOLOGY\nFaster and more reliable\nChaos Spectrum clock-tuning technology maximizes speed and battery life while minimizing degradation commonly caused by temperature, humidity, aging and part-to-part variances.\n\nG900 CHAOS SPECTRUM \nMECHANICAL PIVOT BUTTON DESIGN\nFast, accurate and reliable click performance\nA metal spring tensioning system and metal pivot hinges are built into left and right mouse buttons for a crisp, clean click feel with rapid click feedback.
