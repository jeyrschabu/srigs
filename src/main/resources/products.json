With drives up to 8TB, WD Red offers a wide array of solutions for customers looking to build the biggest, best-performing NAS storage solution. Built for single-bay to 8-bay NAS systems, WD Red packs the power to store your precious data in one powerhouse unit. With WD Red, you're ready for what's next.\n\nExclusive NASware 3.0\nNot just any drive will do. In single-bay to 8-bay NAS systems, WD Red raises the bar. Get as much as 64TB capacity, and with WD's exclusive NASware 3.0, you can optimize every single one of them. Built into every WD Red hard drive, NASware 3.0's advanced technology improves your system's storage performance by increasing compatibility, integration, upgradeability, and reliability.\n\nBuilt for optimum NAS compatibility\nDesktop drives aren't purpose-built for NAS. But WD Red drives with NASware are. Our exclusive technology takes the guesswork out of selecting a drive. WD Red is for small NAS systems, and our unique algorithm balances performance and reliability in NAS and RAID environments. Simply put, WD Red is the most compatible drive available for NAS enclosures. But don't take our word for it. WD Red is a reflection of the most extensive NAS partner compatibility-testing list that is available on the market.*\n*Compatibility list as of March 2016\n\nDesktop drives vs. WD Red\nIn a Network Attached Storage device, a desktop hard drive is not designed for NAS environments. Do right by your NAS and choose the drive with an array of features to preserve your data and maintain optimum performance. Take the following into consideration when choosing a hard drive for your NAS:\nCompatibility: Without being tested for compatibility with your NAS system, optimum performance is not guaranteed.\nReliability: The always-on environment of a NAS or RAID is a hot one. And desktop drives aren't typically designed and tested in those conditions. WD Red is.\nError recovery Controls: WD Red NAS hard drives are specifically designed with RAID error recovery control to help reduce failures within the NAS system. Desktop drives are typically not designed for RAID environments where this can be an issue.\nNoise and Vibration Protection: Designed to operate solo, desktop drives offer little or no protection from the noise and vibration faced in a multi-drive system. WD Red drives are designed for multi-bay NAS systems.\n\nWD Red for Home\nStream, backup, share and organize your digital content at home with a NAS and WD Red drives designed to effortlessly share content to the devices in your home. Red NASware increases your drives' compatibility with your devices, TV, stereo and more. Live in a connected world.\n\nWD Red for Small Business\nBusinesses thrive on productivity and efficiency - two of the guiding principles built into the design of WD Red.

This is far higher than the temperatures generated by everyday computing, so X99-E WS is built for endurance. Our 12K capacitors also boast lowered equivalent series resistance (ESR) for increased efficiency and minimized heat generation - improving overall performance!\n\n\nX99-E WS\nProCool Power Connectors \n\nASUS ProCool is the power connector reinvented! Compared with traditional power connectors, ProCool connectors ensure an exceptionally close and secure connection with the X99-E WS motherboard. This design is much stronger, and it also benefits power efficiency: the flush connection enables lower impedance and better heat dissipation, allowing cooler operating temperature.\n\n\nBeat Thermal Choke \nHigher Stability and Lower Power Loss with Beat Thermal Choke \n\nASUS Beat Thermal Chokes deliver great durability and up to 93% power efficiency under normal operation. A special fin design results in 3-5? lower choke temps for added stability, which is increased exponentially by use of highly conductive and efficient gold-treated coating. This translates into minimal-loss power delivery.\n\n\nDr. MOS MOSFET \nDr. MOS - The Do-More MOSFET \n\nX99-E WS benefits from an integrated Driver-MOSFET (Dr. MOS) that both saves space and reduces operating temperatures. Compared with traditional MOSFET designs, the Dr. MOS high-side and low-side MOSFETs and built-in driver extend component lifespan and enhances power efficiency.\n\nEasy Maintenance",
