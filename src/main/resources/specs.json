The premium power solution consists of four pillars to achieve its 94% premium efficiency: Beat Thermal Choke, Dr. MOS, 12K capacitor, and Digi+ VRM. A special fin design of Beat-Thermal-Choke results in 37 - 41�F (3 - 5�C)-lower choke temperatures and higher stability, and translates into minimal-loss power delivery. The Dr. MOS is a proven stable circuit integrated MOSFET, which optimizes the switching performance and contributes to system efficiency. ASUS DIGI+ VRM design empowers users with superior flexibility and has the perfect precision to ensure optimized performance, extreme system stability. Moreover, ASUS is the world�s first server manufacturer to introduce 12K solid capacitors which are able to withstand up to 1,200,000 hours of temperatures as high as 149�F (65�C) (12K hours @ 221�F (105�C)). These 12K capacitors can also lower equivalent series resistance (ESR) and thus increase efficiency and minimal heat generation.\n\n\nQuick Initialization Guidance\nThe ASUS Z10 Series features quick initialization guidance, letting users initialize the system in seconds; furthermore, users are able to their diagnose system instantly through POST code message in the POST stage. The quick initialization guidance during the POST includes two phases. In phase 1, the POST screen appears in seconds to give users instant access to system initializing status. In phase 2, device scanning information and two-digit POST code messages are available to give users a total understanding of the startup process and to clearly indicate boot-up status, making maintenance easy.\n\n\nComplete Remote Server Management\nThe ASMB8-iKVM (IPMI 2.0-compliant) enables remote update BIOS, standalone KVM/Java utility, video recording, and BSOD capture. Since it's based on out-of-band management, even if the server operating system is down or offline, the KVM module can still provide round-the-clock remote monitoring and diagnosis through a user-friendly web-based graphical interface via all major browsers. In addition, ASWM Enterprise software provides one-to-multiple centralized management, including BIOS flash, software dispatch, task scheduler, remote control, and power control, all through a colorful and informative graphical interface. Through ASUS remote management solutions, users will save time and effort on server management and trouble-shooting.",

That way, you can enjoy the best graphics at the highest framerate jumping off from your screen when running a NVIDIA� SLI� or AMD CrossFire� setup.\n\nZ97M-G43\nZ97M-G43\nMILITARY CLASS 4\n\nMilitary Class 4 is the next step in high quality components. The Dark Choke and Solid CAP will make sure that your PC runs more stable under extreme gaming conditions.\n\n\n\nZ97M-G43SUPER FERRITE CHOKES\n\nuper Ferrite Chokes use a Ferrite core that is Super-Permeable. This allows the Super Ferrite Chokes to run at a 35 degree Celsius lower temperature, have a 30% higher current capacity, a 20% improvement in power efficiency and better overclocking power stability.\n\n\n\nZ97M-G43DARK CHOKE\n\nDark Choke uses the special core design and allows the Dark Choke to run at a lower temperature with higher capacity and better power efficiency and stability.\n\nZ97M-G43\nCarefully selected materials, multiple PCB layers and shielding result in the best circuit protection for our motherboards.\n  Z97M-G43   Z97M-G43\nWith MSI ECO Center you can physically cut the power to unused chips to save up to 29% power usage.\n Z97M-G43\n10% Reduction in moisture absorption helps prevent \"Conductive Anodic Filament\". Untreated PCB's can have 10x higher failure rate.\n  Z97M-G43\nAll key components used in MSI motherboards have all passed military testing ensuring stable operation in the harshest environments.\n  Z97M-G43\nEach and every I/O port is protected against the hazards of Electro Static Discharge.\n\n\n  Z97M-G43\nAll MSI motherboards comply with stringent American FCC regulations and reduce the impact of Electromagnetic Interference.\n Z97M-G43Z97M-G43INTEL� GIGABIT LAN\n\nAlways connected with Intel� Gigabit LAN networking. The latest MSI 9 series motherboards come equipped with the high quality network solution from Intel�. Optimized for multimedia and gaming use to deliver a stable and fast network connection.\n\nZ97M-G43ECO POWER\n\nECO Power helps users to manage their hardware and power usage. Save up to 19% power consumption by completely disabling unnecessary hardware. ECO Power not only lowers the power consumption but also avoids short circuiting and signal noise.",

Built into every WD Red hard drive, NASware 3.0's advanced technology improves your system's storage performance by increasing compatibility, integration, upgradeability, and reliability.\n\nBuilt for optimum NAS compatibility\nDesktop drives aren't purpose-built for NAS. But WD Red drives with NASware are. Our exclusive technology takes the guesswork out of selecting a drive. WD Red is for small NAS systems, and our unique algorithm balances performance and reliability in NAS and RAID environments. Simply put, WD Red is the most compatible drive available for NAS enclosures. But don't take our word for it.

Do right by your NAS and choose the drive with an array of features to preserve your data and maintain optimum performance. Take the following into consideration when choosing a hard drive for your NAS:\nCompatibility: Without being tested for compatibility with your NAS system, optimum performance is not guaranteed.\nReliability: The always-on environment of a NAS or RAID is a hot one. And desktop drives aren't typically designed and tested in those conditions. WD Red is.\nError recovery Controls: WD Red NAS hard drives are specifically designed with RAID error recovery control to help reduce failures within the NAS system. Desktop drives are typically not designed for RAID environments where this can be an issue.\nNoise and Vibration Protection: Designed to operate solo, desktop drives offer little or no protection from the noise and vibration faced in a multi-drive system. WD Red drives are designed for multi-bay NAS systems.\n\nWD Red for Home\nStream, backup, share and organize your digital content at home with a NAS and WD Red drives designed to effortlessly share content to the devices in your home. Red NASware increases your drives' compatibility with your devices, TV, stereo and more. Live in a connected world.\n\nWD Red for Small Business\nBusinesses thrive on productivity and efficiency � two of the guiding principles built into the design of WD Red. It's the hard drive of choice for 1 to 8 bay systems. NASware 3.0 allows for seamless integration with your existing network so WD Red can share and backup files at the speed of your business. And for larger businesses with up to 16 bays, count on WD Red Pro.\n\nWD Red Pro for Big Business\nIf you're looking for maximum performance in a heavy use NAS, WD Red Pro delivers the same exceptional performance for the business customer. For NAS environments with 8 to 16 bays, WD Red Pro is designed to handle an increase in workload and comes with a 5-year limited warranty.",
