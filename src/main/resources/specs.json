Additionally, Z10PE-D16 is equipped for a diverse range of applications, including the use of multiple host bus adapters (HBA).\n\n\nPremium Components for Premium Efficiency\nASUS Z10 Server Board Series are the premium power solution, featuring hand-chosen components and providing premium efficiency of up to 94%. The premium power solution consists of four pillars to achieve its 94% premium efficiency: Beat Thermal Choke, Dr. MOS, 12K capacitor, and Digi+ VRM. A special fin design of Beat-Thermal-Choke results in 37 - 41F (3 - 5C)-lower choke temperatures and higher stability, and translates into minimal-loss power delivery. The Dr. MOS is a proven stable circuit integrated MOSFET, which optimizes the switching performance and contributes to system efficiency. ASUS DIGI+ VRM design empowers users with superior flexibility and has the perfect precision to ensure optimized performance, extreme system stability. Moreover, ASUS is the worlds first server manufacturer to introduce 12K solid capacitors which are able to withstand up to 1,200,000 hours of temperatures as high as 149F (65C) (12K hours @ 221F (105C)). These 12K capacitors can also lower equivalent series resistance (ESR) and thus increase efficiency and minimal heat generation.\n\n\nQuick Initialization Guidance\nThe ASUS Z10 Series features quick initialization guidance, letting users initialize the system in seconds; furthermore, users are able to their diagnose system instantly through POST code message in the POST stage. The quick initialization guidance during the POST includes two phases. In phase 1, the POST screen appears in seconds to give users instant access to system initializing status. In phase 2, device scanning information and two-digit POST code messages are available to give users a total understanding of the startup process and to clearly indicate boot-up status, making maintenance easy.\n\n\nComplete Remote Server Management\nThe ASMB8-iKVM (IPMI 2.0-compliant) enables remote update BIOS, standalone KVM/Java utility, video recording, and BSOD capture. Since it's based on out-of-band management, even if the server operating system is down or offline, the KVM module can still provide round-the-clock remote monitoring and diagnosis through a user-friendly web-based graphical interface via all major browsers. In addition, ASWM Enterprise software provides one-to-multiple centralized management, including BIOS flash, software dispatch, task scheduler, remote control, and power control, all through a colorful and informative graphical interface. Through ASUS remote management solutions, users will save time and effort on server management and trouble-shooting.",

With drives up to 8TB, WD Red offers a wide array of solutions for customers looking to build the biggest, best-performing NAS storage solution. Built for single-bay to 8-bay NAS systems, WD Red packs the power to store your precious data in one powerhouse unit. With WD Red, you're ready for what's next.\n\nExclusive NASware 3.0\nNot just any drive will do. In single-bay to 8-bay NAS systems, WD Red raises the bar. Get as much as 64TB capacity, and with WD's exclusive NASware 3.0, you can optimize every single one of them. Built into every WD Red hard drive, NASware 3.0's advanced technology improves your system's storage performance by increasing compatibility, integration, upgradeability, and reliability.\n\nBuilt for optimum NAS compatibility\nDesktop drives aren't purpose-built for NAS. But WD Red drives with NASware are. Our exclusive technology takes the guesswork out of selecting a drive. WD Red is for small NAS systems, and our unique algorithm balances performance and reliability in NAS and RAID environments. Simply put, WD Red is the most compatible drive available for NAS enclosures. But don't take our word for it. WD Red is a reflection of the most extensive NAS partner compatibility-testing list that is available on the market.*\n*Compatibility list as of March 2016\n\nDesktop drives vs. WD Red\nIn a Network Attached Storage device, a desktop hard drive is not designed for NAS environments. Do right by your NAS and choose the drive with an array of features to preserve your data and maintain optimum performance. Take the following into consideration when choosing a hard drive for your NAS:\nCompatibility: Without being tested for compatibility with your NAS system, optimum performance is not guaranteed.\nReliability: The always-on environment of a NAS or RAID is a hot one. And desktop drives aren't typically designed and tested in those conditions.

    "longDescription": "This 24\" fast gaming monitor - 144Hz refresh rates and 1 ms GTG response time - delivers RevolutionEyes Black eQualizer and Motion Blur Reduction 2.0. Built with perfect motion, fast gaming, precise control, intuitive experience and RevolutionEyes Technology, the 24\" battle machine is at the peak of design perfection.\n\n\nGAMING IS IN THE DETAILS THAT MATTER\nFrom years of expertise in the development of professional gaming monitors and every close encounter with legendary gamers around the world, we have learned that what defines a truly victorious gaming monitor, or should you say \"the best gaming monitor\", really depends on the performance-driven features that make the critical difference between victory and defeat. Gaming is in the details that matter. This is why our engineers and designers strive to perfect every detail that may ultimately contribute to the triumph of the game.\n\n\n\nGAMING REFRESH RATE OPTIMIZATION MANAGEMENT (GROM)\nBenQ manages to provide more than just the refresh rate feature for different resolutions, but allows users to reach more levels of optimal refresh rates (100/120/144Hz) with Gaming Refresh rate Optimization Management (GROM). GROM aims to bring users incomparable gaming performance. With the gamer-driven GROM that collaborates with Display Mode and Smart Scaling strengths, BenQ offers a total refresh rate solution for gaming enthusiasts.\n\n\nFAST 1MS GTG RESPONSE TIME\nA fast response time of 1ms GTG means speed without the smear for an enhanced gaming experience. Fast-moving action and dramatic transitions will be rendered smoothly without the annoying effects of smearing or ghosting. Control your gaming destiny and don't leave it in the hands of a slow display.\n\n\nMOTION BLUR REDUCTION 2.0 FOR BETTER CLARITY THROUGHOUT THE GAME\nBenQ's new Motion Blur Reduction technology further enhances an ultra-smooth, free-of-blur gaming experience, particularly for action-packed FPS games where every millisecond counts. With Motion Blur Reduction, gamers no longer suffer from time and gaming comfort lost to poor vision quality created by motion blur and lagging. Instead, they have everything to gain with more an advantageous reaction time on their side to achieve ultimately a flawless victory.\n\n\n\nBLACK EQUALIZER 2.0 - DYNAMIC WITH AUTOMATIC BRIGHTNESS ADJUSTMENTS\nThe newly improved Black eQualizer Dynamic color engine technology takes visibility optimization to a whole new level with automatic brightness adjustments. The XL2430T is able to detect the input source and automatically fine-tune the amount of brightness enhancement within the range of the brightness level selected by the user. Now, gamers can spot their enemies in critical combat effortlessly and react to any situation quickly without having to lift a finger for manual adjustments.\n\n\n20-LEVEL COLOR VIBRANCE SETTING TO OPTIMIZE GAMING PRECISION\nIt is absolutely vital that the XL2430T give you the flexibility you need to get the color performance you seek. This is why BenQ built into the monitor a 20 level Color Vibrancy setting to meet gamers' specific viewing requirements and preferences for all types of gameplay. This unique feature is accessible via On Screen Display (OSD) or Display Pilot for added convenience.\n\n\nADJUSTMENT SCALE DESIGN FOR EFFORTLESS SET-UP EVERY TIME\nTo ensure that gamers can duplicate the exact same monitor set-up with the highest accuracy, efficiency and convenience, BenQ made a few additions to the XL2430T's Adjustment Scale Design. The adjustable height stand is now scaled with 14 height levels traceable by a moving marker. Traceable scales are also added to the screen, which tilts forward and backward to 0, 10 and 20, and swivels left and right to a wide range of angles. Every XL2430T can be your personal XL2430T.\n\n\nTHE GAME MODE LOADER LETS YOU IN ON THE SECRET\nThe secret is out. Download special gaming presets used by the professional players so you can see what the pros see. Each mode is fine-tuned so you can leverage these exclusive presets used by pro gamers to your own advantage. They can also be saved onto your S Switch for quick access and game play. More presets from professional gamers will be released in the future so you can always stay on top of your game.\nDownload the Game Mode Loader here:  http://gaming.benq.com/downloads/\n\n\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR INDIVIDUAL VIEWING PREFERENCE\nThe Display Mode and Smart Scaling features allow you to change the monitor view to suit your preference and to simulate any in-game experience. Using the Display Mode function, the monitor can be easily changed between 7different screen sizes, from 17\", 19\", 19\"W, 21.5\", 22\"W, 23\"W and 24\"W.\n\nIf you're looking to customize your screen size further, you can also take advantage of the Smart Scaling feature. The Smart Scaling feature gives you the flexibility to freely scale the screen content to any custom size. With just one monitor, you can simulate any game play and practice under different display sizes for tournaments.
