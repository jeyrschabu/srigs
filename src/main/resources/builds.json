EVGA ACX 3.0 once again brings new and exciting features to the award winning EVGA ACX cooling technology. SHP 3.0 gives increased heatpipes and copper contact area for cooler operation, and optimized fan curve for even quieter gaming. Of course, ACX 3.0 coolers also feature optimized swept fan blades, double ball bearings and an extreme low power motor, delivering more air flow with less power, unlocking additional power for the GPU. Select EVGA ACX 3.0 models will even feature a 10CM fan and RGB LED, allowing complete control over the color from EVGA Precision XOC.</p><p>EVGA ACX 3.0 fans use double ball bearings, which offer 4X longer lifespan than the sleeve bearing fans used by competitors.

EVGA ACX 3.0 once again brings new and exciting features to the award winning EVGA ACX cooling technology. SHP 3.0 gives increased heatpipes and copper contact area for cooler operation, and optimized fan curve for even quieter gaming. Of course, ACX 3.0 coolers also feature optimized swept fan blades, double ball bearings and an extreme low power motor, delivering more air flow with less power, unlocking additional power for the GPU. Select EVGA ACX 3.0 models will even feature a 10CM fan and RGB LED, allowing complete control over the color from EVGA Precision XOC.</p><p>EVGA ACX 3.0 fans use double ball bearings, which offer 4X longer lifespan than the sleeve bearing fans used by competitors. The oil that is used in sleeve bearing fans makes them vulnerable and prone to failure after time when the oil dries up. Upgrade to EVGA ACX 3.0 and your card will go the distance!</p><p>Did you know that power consumption of the fans can directly affect your maximum overclock? The maximum “power target” takes into account the fan power consumption, meaning the lower the power consumption from the fan, the more power available for the card.

        "longDescription": "Samsung's innovative 3D V-NAND flash memory architecture breaks through density, performance, and endurance limitations of today's conventional planar NAND architecture. Samsung 3D V-NAND stacks 32 cell layers vertically resulting in higher density and better performance utilizing a smaller footprint.\n\nINCREDIBLE READ/WRITE SPEEDS\nAchieve incredible read/write performance to maximize your everyday computing experience with Samsung's TurboWrite technology. You can obtain up to 1.9x faster performance than the award-winning Samsung 840 EVO. The 850 EVO delivers class-leading performance* in sequential read (540MB/s) and write (520MB/s) speeds. Plus, gain optimized random performance in all QD for better real-world performance. \n\n* Performance compared to 3-Bit MLC-class SSD drives\n\nENHANCED RAPID MODE\nSamsung's Magician software enables RAPID Mode for up to 2x faster performance* by utilizing unused PC memory (DRAM) as a high-speed cache. The newest version of Samsung Magician supports up to a 4 GB cache on a system with 16 GB of DRAM.\n\n* Compared to same drive w/out RAPID enabled. Performance enhancement may vary depending on system hardware & configuration.\n\nGUARANTEED ENDURANCE AND RELIABILITY\nThe 850 EVO doubles the endurance* and reliability** compared to the previous generation 840 EVO** and features a class-leading*** 5 year warranty. With enhanced long-term reliability, the 850 EVO assures longterm dependable performance of up to 30% longer than the previous generation 840 EVO. \n\n* Measured by Terrabytes Written (TBW)\n** Measured with Sustained Performance 12hr Random Write Test\n*** Highest among 3-Bit MLC-class SSD drives\n\nIMPROVED ENERGY EFFICIENCY\nThe 850 EVO delivers significantly longer battery life on your notebook* with a controller designed and optimized for 3D V-NAND that supports Device Sleep for Windows at a highly efficient 2mW. The 850 EVO supports 25% better power efficiency than the 840 EVO during write operations thanks to ultra-efficient 3D V-NAND only consuming half the energy than that of traditional Planar 2D NAND. \n\n* Compared to standard hard drive & previous generation SSDs\n\nSECURE DATA THROUGH ADVANCED AES 256 ENCRYPTION\nThe 850 EVO comes fortified with the latest hardware-based full disk encryption engine. The AES 256-bit hardware encryption secures data without any performance degradation and complies with TCG Opal 2.0. Easily integrate into Windows with Microsoft e-drive IEEE1667 to keep your data protected at all times.\n\nDYNAMIC THERMAL GUARD PROTECTION\nThe 850 EVO's Dynamic Thermal Guard constantly monitors and maintains ideal temperatures for the drive to operate in optimal conditions to ensure the integrity of your data. The Thermal Guard automatically throttles temperatures down when temperatures rise above optimal critical threshold. This protects your data while maintaining responsiveness to help ensure your computer is always safe from overheating.\n\nONE-STOP INSTALL NAVIGATOR SOFTWARE\nIn three simple steps, the Samsung One-stop Install Navigator software easily allows you to migrate all the data and applications from your existing drive to the 850 EVO. The included Samsung Magician software also allows you to setup, optimize, and manage your system for peak SSD performance.\n\nEND-TO-END INTEGRATION SOLUTION\nSamsung is the only brand to design and manufacture all its components inhouse allowing complete optimized integration. The result - the rock-solid EVO 850, with enhanced performance, lower power consumption with an up to 1 GB LPDDR2 DRAM cache memory and improved energy-efficiency with the MEX/MGX controller - all from the #1 memory manufacturer in the world.",
