Consuming just 5.7 W at peak workloads, the 950 PRO secures battery life while maintaining superior performance levels. In standby mode, the 950 PRO consumes only 2.0 milliwatts (mW) of power, less than half the power consumption of a SATA in Device Sleep Mode.*\n\n* This reflects the maximum power consumption of 950 PRO 512 GB compared to 850 PRO 512 GB. Results may vary based on the user environment.\n\nMaximize endurance under heavy workloads\n\nThe innovative V-NAND technology in the 950 PRO increases endurance and prolongs the lifespan with insulators that cause less stress and are more resistant to wear under heavy client workloads over a 5-year period.* The 950 PRO also features Dynamic Thermal Throttling (DTT) technology, which controls the temperature of the device to reduce overheating and maintain a high level of sustained performance.\n\n* 5 years or TBW (256 GB : 200 TB, 512 GB : 400 TB), whichever comes faster.",

        "longDescription": "Samsung's innovative 3D V-NAND flash memory architecture breaks through density, performance, and endurance limitations of today's conventional planar NAND architecture. Samsung 3D V-NAND stacks 32 cell layers vertically resulting in higher density and better performance utilizing a smaller footprint.\n\nINCREDIBLE READ/WRITE SPEEDS\nAchieve incredible read/write performance to maximize your everyday computing experience with Samsung's TurboWrite technology. You can obtain up to 1.9x faster performance than the award-winning Samsung 840 EVO. The 850 EVO delivers class-leading performance* in sequential read (540MB/s) and write (520MB/s) speeds. Plus, gain optimized random performance in all QD for better real-world performance. \n\n* Performance compared to 3-Bit MLC-class SSD drives\n\nENHANCED RAPID MODE\nSamsung's Magician software enables RAPID Mode for up to 2x faster performance* by utilizing unused PC memory (DRAM) as a high-speed cache. The newest version of Samsung Magician supports up to a 4 GB cache on a system with 16 GB of DRAM.\n\n* Compared to same drive w/out RAPID enabled. Performance enhancement may vary depending on system hardware & configuration.\n\nGUARANTEED ENDURANCE AND RELIABILITY\nThe 850 EVO doubles the endurance* and reliability** compared to the previous generation 840 EVO** and features a class-leading*** 5 year warranty. With enhanced long-term reliability, the 850 EVO assures longterm dependable performance of up to 30% longer than the previous generation 840 EVO. \n\n* Measured by Terrabytes Written (TBW)\n** Measured with Sustained Performance 12hr Random Write Test\n*** Highest among 3-Bit MLC-class SSD drives\n\nIMPROVED ENERGY EFFICIENCY\nThe 850 EVO delivers significantly longer battery life on your notebook* with a controller designed and optimized for 3D V-NAND that supports Device Sleep for Windows at a highly efficient 2mW. The 850 EVO supports 25% better power efficiency than the 840 EVO during write operations thanks to ultra-efficient 3D V-NAND only consuming half the energy than that of traditional Planar 2D NAND. \n\n* Compared to standard hard drive & previous generation SSDs\n\nSECURE DATA THROUGH ADVANCED AES 256 ENCRYPTION\nThe 850 EVO comes fortified with the latest hardware-based full disk encryption engine. The AES 256-bit hardware encryption secures data without any performance degradation and complies with TCG Opal 2.0. Easily integrate into Windows with Microsoft e-drive IEEE1667 to keep your data protected at all times.\n\nDYNAMIC THERMAL GUARD PROTECTION\nThe 850 EVO's Dynamic Thermal Guard constantly monitors and maintains ideal temperatures for the drive to operate in optimal conditions to ensure the integrity of your data. The Thermal Guard automatically throttles temperatures down when temperatures rise above optimal critical threshold. This protects your data while maintaining responsiveness to help ensure your computer is always safe from overheating.\n\nONE-STOP INSTALL NAVIGATOR SOFTWARE\nIn three simple steps, the Samsung One-stop Install Navigator software easily allows you to migrate all the data and applications from your existing drive to the 850 EVO. The included Samsung Magician software also allows you to setup, optimize, and manage your system for peak SSD performance.\n\nEND-TO-END INTEGRATION SOLUTION\nSamsung is the only brand to design and manufacture all its components inhouse allowing complete optimized integration. The result - the rock-solid EVO 850, with enhanced performance, lower power consumption with an up to 1 GB LPDDR2 DRAM cache memory and improved energy-efficiency with the MEX/MGX controller - all from the #1 memory manufacturer in the world.",
