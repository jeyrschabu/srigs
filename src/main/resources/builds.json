EVGA ACX 3.0 once again brings new and exciting features to the award winning EVGA ACX cooling technology. SHP 3.0 gives increased heatpipes and copper contact area for cooler operation, and optimized fan curve for even quieter gaming. Of course, ACX 3.0 coolers also feature optimized swept fan blades, double ball bearings and an extreme low power motor, delivering more air flow with less power, unlocking additional power for the GPU. Select EVGA ACX 3.0 models will even feature a 10CM fan and RGB LED, allowing complete control over the color from EVGA Precision XOC.</p><p>EVGA ACX 3.0 fans use double ball bearings, which offer 4X longer lifespan than the sleeve bearing fans used by competitors.

This new graphics card features NVIDIA's new Pascal graphics processor which is the most advanced gaming GPU ever created. This breakthrough GPU delivers industry-leading performance, innovative new gaming technologies, and immersive, next-gen VR. These cards also feature EVGA ACX 3.0 cooling technology. EVGA ACX 3.0 once again brings new and exciting features to the award winning EVGA ACX cooling technology. SHP 3.0 gives increased heatpipes and copper contact area for cooler operation, and optimized fan curve for even quieter gaming. Of course, ACX 3.0 coolers also feature optimized swept fan blades, double ball bearings and an extreme low power motor, delivering more air flow with less power, unlocking additional power for the GPU. Select EVGA ACX 3.0 models will even feature a 10CM fan and RGB LED, allowing complete control over the color from EVGA Precision XOC.</p><p>The next generation of EVGA PrecisionX has arrived with EVGA Precision XOC. This new version of Precision is built for the NVIDIA Pascal architecture and combines the best of EVGA Precision and EVGA OC Scanner to give you never before seen overclocking features and built in automatic overclock tuning. EVGA ACX 3.0 fans use double ball bearings, which offer 4X longer lifespan than the sleeve bearing fans used by competitors. The oil that is used in sleeve bearing fans makes them vulnerable and prone to failure after time when the oil dries up.

EVGA ACX 3.0 once again brings new and exciting features to the award winning EVGA ACX cooling technology. SHP 3.0 gives increased heatpipes and copper contact area for cooler operation, and optimized fan curve for even quieter gaming. Of course, ACX 3.0 coolers also feature optimized swept fan blades, double ball bearings and an extreme low power motor, delivering more air flow with less power, unlocking additional power for the GPU. Select EVGA ACX 3.0 models will even feature a 10CM fan and RGB LED, allowing complete control over the color from EVGA Precision XOC.</p><p>EVGA ACX 3.0 fans use double ball bearings, which offer 4X longer lifespan than the sleeve bearing fans used by competitors. The oil that is used in sleeve bearing fans makes them vulnerable and prone to failure after time when the oil dries up. Upgrade to EVGA ACX 3.0 and your card will go the distance!</p><p>Did you know that power consumption of the fans can directly affect your maximum overclock? The maximum “power target” takes into account the fan power consumption, meaning the lower the power consumption from the fan, the more power available for the card.

EVGA ACX 3.0 coolers use more than 4X lower power than competitors allowing for better and more stable overclocks.</p><ul><li>Base Clock: 1607 MHZ</li><li>Boost Clock: 1797 MHz</li><li>Memory Clock: 8008 MHz Effective</li><li>CUDA Cores: 1920</li><li>Bus Type: PCI-E 3.0</li><li>Memory Detail: 8192MB GDDR5</li><li>Memory Bit Width: 256 Bit</li><li>Memory Speed: 0.25ns</li><li>Memory Bandwidth: 256.3 GB/s</li><li>LED Logo: RGB</li></ul>",

This breakthrough GPU delivers industry-leading performance, innovative new gaming technologies, and immersive, next-gen VR. These cards also feature EVGA ACX 3.0 cooling technology. EVGA ACX 3.0 once again brings new and exciting features to the award winning EVGA ACX cooling technology. SHP 3.0 gives increased heatpipes and copper contact area for cooler operation, and optimized fan curve for even quieter gaming. Of course, ACX 3.0 coolers also feature optimized swept fan blades, double ball bearings and an extreme low power motor, delivering more air flow with less power, unlocking additional power for the GPU. Select EVGA ACX 3.0 models will even feature a 10CM fan and RGB LED, allowing complete control over the color from EVGA Precision XOC.</p><p>EVGA ACX 3.0 fans use double ball bearings, which offer 4X longer lifespan than the sleeve bearing fans used by competitors.
